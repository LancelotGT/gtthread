  The gtthread_init() function does not have a corresponding pthread equivalent.
  It must be called from the main thread before any other GTThreads
  functions are called. It allows the caller to specify the scheduling
  period (quantum in micro second), and may also perform any other
  necessary initialization.

  Recall that the initial thread of the program (i.e. the one running
  main() ) is a thread like any other. It should have a
  gtthread_t that clients can retrieve by calling gtthread_self()
  from the initial thread, and they should be able to specify it as an
  argument to other GTThreads functions. The only difference in the
  initial thread is how it behaves when it executes a return
  instruction. You can find details on this difference in the man page
  for pthread_create.
